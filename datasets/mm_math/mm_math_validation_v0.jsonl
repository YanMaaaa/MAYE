Now, here comes the star of our show, point $F$, frolicking along the diagonal $AC$. Our mission? To find the minimum perimeter of the triangle $BFE$. \n\nFirst, let's connect the dots, literally. We draw lines $DB$, $DE$, and $DF$, making our diagram look like a spider web of geometry. Since we're dealing with a square, $AB$ and $AD$ are both 8 units long, and that corner, $\\angle BAD$, is a perfect 90 degrees. The diagonal $AC$ slices through the square, acting as a trusty perpendicular bisector of $BD$. This means $BF$ and $DF$ are two peas in a pod \u2013 they're equal!\n\nNow, $BE$ is a cute little 2-unit segment, which makes $AE$ a robust $6$ units (because $AB - BE = 8 - 2$). The perimeter of our triangle $BFE$ is the sum of $BE$, $BF$, and $EF$. In mathematical terms, that's $2 + DF + EF$. \n\nBut here's the catch: the shortest path between two points is a straight line. So, when $D$, $F$, and $E$ decide to line up like good little collinear points, $DF + EF$ hits rock bottom. This minimal sum is just the length of $DE$. \n\nSo, let's find $DE$. In our right triangle $ADE$, we use the Pythagorean Theorem to get $DE = \\sqrt{AD^2 + AE^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 + 6^2} = 10$. \n\nThus, the minimum perimeter of $\\triangle BFE$ is $2 + DE = 2 + 10 = \\boxed{12}$.

Now, here's a twist\u2014literally\u2014$AC$ is perpendicular to $A'B'$. Who would've thought a little spin could cause such a perpendicular commotion?\n\nFirst, we identify the intersection point of $AC$ and $A'B'$ as our friend, point O.

It turns out, by the magical properties of isosceles triangles, that $\\angle CA'A$ and $\\angle CAA'$ both clock in at 70 degrees. Why? Because the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, and we're left with a 70 degree angle on each side after subtracting that 40 degree rotation.\n\nSince $AC$ is perpendicular to $A'B'$, we have $\\angle A'OC$ as 90 degrees. No surprises there; it's as straight as a right angle gets. Now, to find $\\angle CA'O$, we subtract the known angles from 180 degrees, leaving us with a tidy 50 degrees.\n\nFinally, the grand reveal: $\\angle AA'B'$.

Sounds like a job for some serious math action!\n\nWe start by drawing a line DE through point D parallel to the y-axis, intersecting AC at point E. Why DE, you ask? Well, why not? It's all part of the plan. So, we calculate the x-coordinate of our vertex using the formula $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$, and after some number crunching, we find it to be $-\\frac{3}{2}$. With B at (1, 0), logic dictates A must be at (-4, 0). Aha! The distance between A and B, or AB, is a neat 5 units. \n\nNow, let's talk about triangles. The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is a simple $\\frac{1}{2} \\times AB \\cdot OC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 3 = 7.5$. Not bad, right? Moving forward, we concoct the equation of line AC, which comes out as $y = -\\frac{3}{4}x - 3$. It's like a math cocktail with a slope of $-\\frac{3}{4}$ and a y-intercept of -3. Cheers!\n\nFor point D, we let it be (a, $\\frac{3}{4}a^{2} + \\frac{9}{4}a - 3$) and E becomes (a, $-\\frac{3}{4}a - 3$). DE, our vertical line segment, is $-\\frac{3}{4}(a+2)^2 + 3$. When a is -2, DE reaches its maximum value of 3. It's like DE reached its peak and said, \"This is as good as it gets!\"\n\nThe maximum area of $\\triangle ADC$ is then $\\frac{1}{2} \\times DE \\cdot AO = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4 = 6$. Adding it all up, the maximum area of quadrilateral AOCD is the sum of the areas of $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle ACD$, which is 7.5 + 6 = 13.5. Voil\u00e0! We've done it. The maximum area of quadrilateral AOCD is $\\boxed{13.5}$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{13.5}</t>\n\\textbf{Solution:} As shown in Figure 1: draw line DE through point D parallel to y-axis, intersecting AC at point E.\n\nSince $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}=\\frac{-\\frac{9}{4}}{2\\times \\frac{3}{4}}=-\\frac{3}{2}$, B(1,0),\n\ntherefore, A(-4,0).\n\nThus, AB=5.\n\nTherefore, $S_{\\triangle ABC}=\\frac{1}{2}$AB$\\cdot$OC$=\\frac{1}{2}\\times 5\\times 3=7.5$.\n\nSuppose the equation of AC is $y=kx+b$.\n\nSince substituting A(-4,0) and C(0,-3) gives $\\begin{cases}-4k+b=0\\\\ b=-3\\end{cases}$, we solve to get $\\begin{cases}k=-\\frac{3}{4}\\\\ b=-3\\end{cases}$,\n\nTherefore, the equation of line AC is $y=-\\frac{3}{4}x-3$.\n\nLet D(a, $\\frac{3}{4}a^{2}+\\frac{9}{4}a-3$), then E(a, $-\\frac{3}{4}a-3$).\n\nSince DE$=-\\frac{3}{4}a-3-\\left(\\frac{3}{4}a^{2}+\\frac{9}{4}a-3\\right)=-\\frac{3}{4}(a+2)^{2}+3$,\n\nTherefore, when $a=-2$, DE reaches its maximum value of 3.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area of $\\triangle ADC =\\frac{1}{2}$DE$\\cdot$AO$=\\frac{1}{2}\\times 3\\times 4=6$.\n\nTherefore, $S_{\\text{quadrilateral }ABCD}$=$S_{\\triangle ABC}$+$S_{\\triangle ACD}$=7.5+6=\\boxed{13.5},\n\nThus, the maximum area of quadrilateral ABCD is \\boxed{13.5}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{13.5}"}

I'm thinking, \"Why do ratios always show up uninvited to these geometry parties?\"\n\nBut wait, there's more! We know $EF = 6$, and I'm guessing we need to find the length of $DE$. So, let's play the ratio game. Since $AD \\parallel BE \\parallel CF$, we can confidently declare that $\\frac{AB}{BC} = \\frac{DE}{EF}$. It's like these segments are in a secret club where they all agree to share the same ratio.\n\nSo, let's get our math hats on: $\\frac{DE}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$. Solving this little equation, we multiply both sides by 6 (because who doesn't love a good multiplication?). \n\nAnd voila, $DE = 4$. I must say, this was smoother than I expected.
